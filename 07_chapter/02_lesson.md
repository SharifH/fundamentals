# HTML BOILERPLATE
Let’s review some of the key ideas introduced in this unit. You can also download all this content for future reference by clicking on the attached file.

In order to organize tags properly, start with a set of structural elements called the HTML boilerplate. It should look like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
     <head>

     </head>
     <body>

     </body>
</html>
```


<div class="wistia_responsive_padding" style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><div class="wistia_responsive_wrapper" style="height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;width:100%;"><iframe src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/98q1272934?seo=false&videoFoam=true" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="wistia_embed" name="wistia_embed" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen width="100%" height="100%"></iframe></div></div>
<script src="//fast.wistia.net/assets/external/E-v1.js" async></script>

HTML vs. CSS

So what’s the difference between HTML and CSS? And when do I use each?

HTML, or Hyper*Text **Markup **L*anguage, is the standard language used to code web pages. All of the content on a website is added with HTML.

CSS or Cascading Style Sheets, decides how the content written in an HTML document looks, such as the layout, colors, and fonts.

Common HTML Elements

Headline Elements: are meant to be used for important text that titles the content that comes after it. They range from —the largest—to —the smallest.

<h1>This would make a big headline</h1>
Paragraph Elements: are one of the most basic tags in HTML. They indicate blocks of text.

<p>This would add a block of text to a page</p>
Anchor Elements: are the tags we use to create links. In order to make a working link, we have to add more information to the anchor tag, using an href attribute.

<a href="www.generalassemb.ly>This would make this whole
sentence a link to General Assembly's home page.</a>
