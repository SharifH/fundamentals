Time to give it a whirl! In this exercise you'll be getting some practice setting up and updating a contacts array. Later in this unit we'll be adding some complexity and creating a more robust contact book that allows us to store more detailed information, add new contacts, list contacts, and search contacts by first or last name.

### Instructions

Write your first hyperlinks: the magical things that you click to get from here to there on the web.

Let's start with some content!

```
Hi, I'm awesome.
Follow me on twitter.
Send me an email.
```


1. Give your website some content: introduce yourself, mention one social media account (or any website of your choosing), and ask for an email.
2. Wrap your header in h1 tags, and the rest of your content with paragraph tags.
3. Remember that HTML tags are reusable, so you can use as many of each kind as you need. Add some more html tags.
