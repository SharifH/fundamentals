##Caching a query

If we'd like to work with that element multiple times, a variable should be used to store, or **cache**, the results of our query. When we store an element in a variable, what we are doing behind the scenes is storing a reference to the location of the element in the DOM tree. We can then use any methods we would normally use on an element on that variable.
